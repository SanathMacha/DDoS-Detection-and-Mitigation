Notebook
---------
1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset  
	- CIC-DDoS-2019
	- SDN Dataset
	- SlowRateSDN Data
	- Own Dataset
3. Data Processing
	- Removing Duplicate Data
	- Drop Cleaning  
	- Normalizer 
4. Data Visualization
5. Label Encoder 
	- Converting the Str to Int
6. Feature Selection
	- MI
7. Splitting the dataset in train and validation 
8. Building the model for all dataset
	
	- BernoulliNB
	- PassiveAggressive
	- SGDClassifier
	- MLP 
	- Hybrid Model of All Above
	- Extension - Bagging with RF + Boosted DT

9. Training and Building the model
10. Comparing the models with accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score,  
11. Comparison graphs are generated with scores of all models.



FrontEnd
--------

12. Frontend is developed with help of Flask Framework, along with Registration and Login setup with support of Sqlite DB
13. For the frontend we used the data for predicting the attack detection
14. User gives input as Feature Values 
15. The given input is preprocessed for prediction
16. Trained model is used for prediction
17. Final outcome is displayed through frontend



Extension
----------

In the base paper the author mentioned to  use  different IDS attack type dataset with different ML models for analysis and prediction for selected features with 
help MI FS,
As an extension we applied an ensemble method  combining the predictions of multiple individual models to produce a more robust and accurate final prediction. 
However, we can further enhance the performance by ensemble techniques such as  Voting Classifier for analysis the data,
As an extension we can build the front end using the flask framework for user testing and with user authentication.
